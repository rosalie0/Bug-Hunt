## Play Again

- [ ] have it reset the timer
- [ ] have it bring back up the div that covers the 3d

## models

## ideas for game

### audio

### additional fields for the game:

- [ ] adding a timer to each level
- [x] add a timer for the whole game

### Recording Score

### recording your best score locally

- [ ] have a local storage for 'your personal best'

### recording the score using Firebase

- [x] Set up 'backend' to allow a 'leaderboard' collection, with entries having a `name` and `time` field (time they beat the game in)

## advancing levels

- [ ] have an inbetween screen telling user they advanced to next level
  - have a button to start the next level
  - [ ] maybe display their score?
