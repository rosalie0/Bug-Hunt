## What is Bug Hunt?

Bug Hunt is a simple 'cookie clicker' that combines rendering 3-D in the browser & game mechanics. Each level has its own background, which is a 360 HDRI photo, where the user can move their view angle via the mouse. They are tasked with earning points by clicking on different bugs that are randomly generated in position, rotation, and color. Upon a click, they rerender to another random spot.
There are currently only two levels, and a 'You Win' screen.
